# GPT-3-Letter-writer
Python to write letter by description using gpt-3 api 

In the code above, you need to replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key. Make sure you have the OpenAI Python package installed, which you can install using pip install openai. You also need to install the python-docx library, which you can install using pip install python-docx.

The generate_letter() function sends a prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves the generated letter content. You can adjust the parameters such as max_tokens, temperature, and n to control the response length and creativity.

The save_as_word_file() function creates a new Word document, adds the generated content as a paragraph, and saves it with the specified filename.

After running the code, it will prompt you to enter the prompt for the letter. The code will generate the letter content using the GPT-3 API and save it as a Word file named 'letter.docx'. You can modify the output filename as needed.
